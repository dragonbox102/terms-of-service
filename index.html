        <h2>2. Data Collection, Storage, and Privacy Protocol for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>The operational efficiency of <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> necessitates the storage of specific configuration and runtime data. We are committed to a philosophy of <strong>minimal data collection</strong>, focusing exclusively on data essential for its functionality within Discord servers, <strong>without infringing upon personal privacy.</strong> Data is now stored securely in private databases managed by the Bot, and no confidential or personal information is stored.</p>

        <h3>2.1. Stored Data Schematics:</h3>
        <p>The Bot maintains database records with the following structures and purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Configuration Data:</strong>
                <p>This persistent data stores per-Discord server settings. Its integrity is crucial for maintaining your guild's customized <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server IDs (Discord Guild IDs):</strong> Unique identifiers assigned by Discord to identify each server where the Bot is active.</li>
                    <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> Specific Discord channel IDs designated for Bot notifications such as announcements, gear updates, event broadcasts, and weather advisories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Setup Status:</strong> A boolean indicating if the server setup is complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bot Admin Roles:</strong> A collection of roles authorized to use administrative commands, including the User ID of the admin who configured it and the timestamp of addition.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Temporary & Runtime Data:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual Stock Data: Optional, currently empty unless configured.</li>
                    <li>Manual Weather Data: Optional overrides for events.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Flags: Temporary indicators for downtime or maintenance.</li>
                    <li>Backup Records: Database backups for recovery and data integrity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Core Privacy Tenets:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal User Data (PII):</strong> Only Discord IDs for admins are stored for auditing. User messages, usernames, DMs, or private content are never stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Level Data Only:</strong> All data relates to server configurations and not individual users.</li>
            <li><strong>Local & Database Storage:</strong> Data is stored in private databases managed solely by the Bot.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Sharing:</strong> Stored configuration data is never shared or sold to third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephemeral Data & Cleanup:</strong> Temporary runtime data is automatically cleared when no longer needed.</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2>3. Service Availability & Resilience</h2>
        <p>The Bot is delivered on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. No guarantees are made regarding uninterrupted service or error-free operation. External factors such as Discord API outages or network issues may impact performance. Functionality may be modified, suspended, or decommissioned at any time without prior notice.</p>

        ---

        <h2>4. Limitations of Liability & Risk Acceptance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inaccuracies or omissions in game-related stock data.</li>

            <li>Direct or indirect damages from using or being unable to use the Bot.</li>
            <li>Actions or inactions of third-party users or administrators.</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2>6. Amendment & Evolution of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms are subject to revision at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of updated Terms. Users should periodically review the Terms for changes.</p>

        ---

        <h2>7. Developer Access and Internal Command Usage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Restricted Developer Command â€“ <code>!join</code>:</strong> The developer may join servers temporarily to inspect bot behavior or configuration.</li>
            <li>Visits are non-intrusive and no messages or content are stored.</li>
        </ul>
