        <h2>2. Data Collection, Storage, and Privacy Protocol for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>The operational efficiency of **Grow a Garden Stocks** necessitates the storage of specific configuration and runtime data. We are committed to a philosophy of **minimal data collection**, focusing exclusively on data essential for its functionality within Discord servers, **without infringing upon personal privacy.**</p>

        <h3>2.1. Stored Data Schematics:</h3>
        <p>The Bot maintains localized data files with the following structures and purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Configuration Data (<code>server_config.json</code>):</strong>
                <p>This persistent data structure stores per-Discord server settings. Its integrity is crucial for maintaining your guild's customized **Grow a Garden Stocks** experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>Server IDs</code> (Discord Guild IDs):</strong> Unique 64-bit unsigned integers assigned by Discord to identify each server where **Grow a Garden Stocks** is active. This is a public identifier and is essential for routing commands and notifications to the correct guild.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Channel IDs</code>:</strong> Specific Discord channel IDs (64-bit unsigned integers) designated by server administrators for various Bot notifications, including but not limited to general announcements, gear updates, egg alerts, event broadcasts, and weather advisories related to "Grow a Garden." This data dictates where **Grow a Garden Stocks** sends its output.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Setup Status</code>:</strong> A boolean flag indicating the completion status of the initial server setup process for **Grow a Garden Stocks**. This assists the Bot in guiding new installations.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Bot Admin Roles</code>:</strong> A collection of Discord Role IDs (64-bit unsigned integers) that are explicitly authorized to invoke specific administrative commands of **Grow a Garden Stocks**. For auditing and security purposes, each entry includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><code>Role ID</code> and <code>name</code>:</strong> The unique identifier and human-readable name of the Discord role.</li>
                            <li><strong><code>User ID of who added the role</code>:</strong> The Discord User ID (64-bit unsigned integer) of the administrator who configured this role. This is used strictly for internal security and audit trails to track configuration changes made within **Grow a Garden Stocks**.</li>
                            <li><strong><code>Date when role was added</code>:</strong> A timestamp recording when the role was configured as a **Grow a Garden Stocks** admin.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Data Files (<code>data/</code> directory):</strong>
                <p>These files manage runtime state and accommodate manual administrative overrides. They are typically ephemeral or subject to automated cleanup protocols by **Grow a Garden Stocks**.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>Manual Stock Data</code> (<code>manual_stock.json</code>):</strong> Currently provisioned for future functionality or testing, this file is designed to store manually input stock data for "Grow a Garden," if and when such a feature is implemented. At present, it remains empty.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Manual Weather Data</code> (<code>manual_weather.txt</code>):</strong> Stores administrative overrides for weather conditions within "Grow a Garden," allowing for manual intervention in specific scenarios. This data is temporary and intended for direct administrator control.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Maintenance Flags</code> (<code>maintenance.flag</code>):</strong> Transient files indicating **Grow a Garden Stocks**' current operational mode, specifically when it is undergoing maintenance. These are automatically generated and purged.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>Backup Files</code> (<code>.backup</code> extensions):</strong> Timestamped copies of configuration files generated for data integrity and disaster recovery purposes for **Grow a Garden Stocks**. These are local and managed internally by the Bot.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Core Privacy Tenets for Grow a Garden Stocks:</h3>
        <p>Our commitment to your privacy is unwavering. **Grow a Garden Stocks** operates under the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal User Data (PII):</strong> **Grow a Garden Stocks** is architected NOT to collect, log, or store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) beyond what is explicitly mentioned for administrative auditing (e.g., the User ID of an administrator adding a role). This includes, crucially, no storage of individual user messages, direct messages, usernames (other than for administrative role tracking as noted above), or any other private user data.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Level Data Only:</strong> All collected and stored data pertains exclusively to the configuration and operational state of the Discord server itself for **Grow a Garden Stocks**, not to the activities or identities of individual users within that server.</li>
            <li><strong>Discord IDs as Public Identifiers:</strong> The only "user-related" identifiers stored by **Grow a Garden Stocks** are Discord's public identifiers (Server IDs, Channel IDs, Role IDs, and the User ID of the specific administrator who modifies admin roles). These are numerical identifiers provided by Discord's API and are not considered PII in this context.</li>
            <li><strong>No Message Content Logging:</strong> **Grow a Garden Stocks** does not log, store, or otherwise persist the content of any messages sent by users within Discord. Message processing is ephemeral and solely for command recognition and execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Paradigm:</strong> All aforementioned data is stored locally within the Bot's operational environment, typically in JSON-formatted files. No external databases, cloud storage, or third-party data services are utilized by **Grow a Garden Stocks** for storing this configuration data.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Activity Tracking for Audit:</strong> The tracking of which administrator added a Bot admin role is a security and audit feature, designed to enhance accountability within a server's administrative team for the configuration of **Grow a Garden Stocks**, not to track individual user behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephemeral Data & Automated Cleanup:</strong> Temporary operational files, such as maintenance flags, are designed for automatic generation and subsequent deletion upon the completion of their lifecycle by **Grow a Garden Stocks**.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Data Sharing:</strong> Stored configuration data is used exclusively for the Bot's internal functionality and its seamless operation within Discord. This data is never shared, sold, rented, or transmitted to any external entities, third parties, or advertising networks by **Grow a Garden Stocks**.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Should any concerns or inquiries arise regarding the intricate details of data handling by **Grow a Garden Stocks**, we encourage you to initiate direct communication with the Bot developer for comprehensive clarification. Your understanding is paramount.</p>
