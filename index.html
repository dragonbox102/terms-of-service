        <h2 id="sec1">1. Permitted & Prohibited Operational Modalities</h2>
        <p>To ensure optimal system performance and a harmonious ecosystem within your "Grow a Garden" ventures, your engagement with the Bot is bound by the following protocols:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fair Use Doctrine:</strong> You shall refrain from engaging in any form of abuse, unsolicited message proliferation (spamming), or exploitation of any known or yet-to-be-discovered vulnerabilities within the Service's architecture. This includes, but is not limited to, actions designed to degrade performance, consume excessive resources, or bypass intended rate limits of <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Authorized Deployment:</strong> The Bot's deployment and subsequent operation are strictly limited to Discord guilds where you possess the requisite administrative privileges, explicitly granted by the guild owner or an authorized administrator. Unauthorized deployment or manipulation of <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> is expressly forbidden.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Integrity:</strong> Any attempt to decompile, disassemble, reverse-engineer, modify, derive source code from, or otherwise tamper with the Bot's compiled binaries, algorithms, or any underlying components of <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> is unequivocally prohibited. The intellectual property of the Bot remains with its developer.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Commercial Stipulation:</strong> The Bot is engineered and provided solely for non-commercial, recreational, and informational purposes. Any form of commercial resale, monetization, financial exploitation, or direct/indirect profit generation through the services provided by <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> is strictly forbidden without explicit, prior written authorization from the Bot's developer. This includes, but is not limited to, integrating the Bot into paid services or using its output for commercial ventures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="sec2">2. Data Collection, Storage, and Privacy Protocol for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>The operational efficiency of <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> necessitates the storage of specific configuration and runtime data. We are committed to a philosophy of <strong>minimal data collection</strong>, focusing exclusively on data essential for its functionality within Discord servers, <strong>without infringing upon personal privacy.</strong></p>

        <h3>2.1. Storage Model</h3>
        <p>
            The Bot now stores configuration and operational data in <strong>secure, private databases</strong> managed by the Owner. These databases are accessible only to authorized service components and personnel. They contain <em>the same categories of information previously described</em> in earlier versions of this document (which referenced local JSON files); no confidential or sensitive personal information is collected or retained.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security & Access:</strong> Database access is restricted, authenticated, and monitored. Raw database contents are not publicly accessible.</li>
            <li><strong>Backups & Integrity:</strong> Periodic backups may be performed solely for integrity and disaster recovery. Backups are stored privately under the same access controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Data is retained only as long as necessary for bot functionality, troubleshooting, or auditability, and may be purged when no longer required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Stored Data Schematics</h3>
        <p>The Bot maintains the following server-level data (illustrative fields shown):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Configuration Data</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Server ID</code> (Discord Guild ID)</li>
                    <li><code>Channel IDs</code> for notifications (e.g., announcements, gear, eggs, events, weather)</li>
                    <li><code>Setup Status</code> (boolean)</li>
                    <li><code>Bot Admin Roles</code> with: <code>Role ID</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>addedByUserId</code>, <code>addedAt</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Operational / Runtime Data (as applicable)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrative overrides (e.g., manual weather or stock inputs if enabled)</li>
                    <li>Maintenance mode flags / feature toggles</li>
                    <li>Configuration backups / revision history</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3. Core Privacy Tenets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal User Data (PII):</strong> The Bot is architected NOT to collect, log, or store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) beyond what is explicitly mentioned for administrative auditing (e.g., the User ID of an administrator adding a role). It does not store individual user messages or direct messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-Level Data Only:</strong> All collected and stored data pertains exclusively to the configuration and operational state of the Discord server itself, not to the activities or identities of regular users within that server.</li>
            <li><strong>Discord IDs as Public Identifiers:</strong> Stored identifiers are numerical IDs provided by Discord (server, channel, role, and the administrator user ID who changed admin roles). These are used strictly for routing, permissions, and audit trails.</li>
            <li><strong>No Message Content Logging:</strong> Message content is not logged or persisted. Processing is ephemeral for command recognition and execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Storage Paradigm:</strong> Data is stored in private databases managed by the Owner. No external data brokers or advertising networks are used.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Activity Tracking for Audit:</strong> Tracking of which administrator added a Bot admin role enhances accountability and security within a server's administrative team.</li>
            <li><strong>Ephemeral Data & Automated Cleanup:</strong> Temporary operational data is generated as needed and deleted upon completion of its lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Data Sharing:</strong> Configuration and operational data are used exclusively for internal functionality and are not sold, rented, or shared with third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have questions about data handling, contact the Owner for clarification.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="sec3">3. Service Availability & Resilience for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>The Bot is delivered on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. While the developer endeavors to maximize operational uptime and stability, no explicit or implied guarantees are provided regarding uninterrupted service or error-free operation. External factors, including but not limited to Discord API outages, host server issues, network latency, and unforeseen software anomalies, may impact performance. Features may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time, with or without notice, at the sole discretion of the developer.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="sec4">4. Limitations of Liability & Risk Acceptance for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>Use of the Bot is at your sole discretion and risk. The developer, its affiliates, and contributors are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data corruption, or business interruption, arising from or connected with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inaccuracies, omissions, or timing discrepancies in game-related stock data, market fluctuations, or other dynamic information.</li>
            <li>Failure to deliver notifications, alerts, or messages due to network issues, API limitations, or processing delays.</li>
            <li>Use, misuse, or inability to use the Bot's services.</li>
            <li>Actions or inactions of third-party users or administrators within your Discord guild regarding the Bot's commands or configuration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You acknowledge that potential discrepancies or outages are inherent risks of utilizing external digital services.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="sec5">5. Termination of Access Protocols for Grow a Garden Stocks</h2>
        <p>The developer reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or permanently revoke access to the Bot or any of its functionalities for any user or Discord guild determined to be in violation of these Terms, Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>, or Discord's <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a>. Such termination may occur at any time, without prior notice, and without liability for any associated data loss or service interruption.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="sec6">6. Amendment & Evolution of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service represent a dynamic document, subject to revision and amendment at any time without explicit individual notification. Modifications are effective immediately upon publication within the Bot's official documentation or announcement channels. Continued use following any modification constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. You are responsible for periodically reviewing these Terms for changes.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="sec7">7. Developer Access and Internal Command Usage</h2>
        <p>For maintenance, diagnostics, moderation compliance, and service consistency, <strong>Grow a Garden Stocks</strong> includes a limited-access internal command system available solely to the Bot's developer (the "Owner").</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Restricted Developer Command – <code>!join</code>:</strong> The Owner may generate a temporary invite link to any Discord guild in which the Bot is active, to facilitate inspection or testing. This command is not accessible to regular users or server administrators.</li>
            <li><strong>Owner-Initiated Server Entry:</strong> By using the internal command, the Owner may, without prior notification, join a guild solely to inspect bot behavior, configuration integrity, and adherence to these Terms and Discord’s standards. Such visits are brief and non-intrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Assurance:</strong> No user messages, server activity, or content is recorded or extracted during these sessions. Visits are solely to validate appropriate use and ensure proper operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
